# FakeNewsDetection
Built and trained an LSTM-based machine learning model for fake news detection. Conducted data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and data cleaning. Developed an understanding of recurrent neural networks and LSTM architecture. Evaluated model performance to measure its effectiveness in accurately detecting fake news.
